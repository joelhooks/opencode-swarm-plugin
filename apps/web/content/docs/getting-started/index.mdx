## What is Swarm Tools?

Swarm Tools enables multiple AI agents to work together on complex tasks. The system provides primitives for:

- **Task Decomposition** - Break large tasks into parallelizable subtasks
- **File Reservations** - Prevent edit conflicts between concurrent agents
- **Progress Tracking** - Monitor swarm status and completion
- **Learning** - Improve decomposition strategies over time

## Core Components

### Beads Issue Tracking

Git-backed issue tracking that integrates with swarm workflows:

- Epics and subtasks for hierarchical work breakdown
- Dependency tracking (block/blocked-by relationships)
- Status management (open, in-progress, blocked, closed)
- JSONL export for distributed collaboration

### Agent Mail

Inter-agent communication for coordination:

- Async messaging between agents
- File reservation system for exclusive edits
- Thread-based conversations grouped by task

### Swarm Coordination

The orchestration layer that ties everything together:

- Intelligent task decomposition with strategy selection
- Parallel agent spawning with fresh context per task
- Automated conflict detection and resolution
- Learning from outcomes to improve future swarms
