# Architecture Decisions & Design Reviews

This section documents significant technical decisions, architectural patterns, and engineering design reviews for the OpenCode Swarm Plugin.

## What's Here?

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** - Captures the reasoning behind major technical choices, alternatives considered, and trade-offs made.

**Engineering Design Reviews (EDRs)** - Deep feasibility studies and research into potential features or refactors.

## Contributing

When making significant technical decisions:

1. **Create an ADR** - Document the problem, alternatives, decision, and consequences
2. **Use the template** - See existing ADRs for structure
3. **Update this index** - Add your ADR to the decision log table
4. **Link from code** - Reference ADRs in comments when implementing decisions
