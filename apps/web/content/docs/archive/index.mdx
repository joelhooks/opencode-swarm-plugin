# Archive

Historical documentation that provides context but isn't actively maintained.

## What's Here

### Roadmap

Future plans and experimental features. Updated periodically but not guaranteed to be current.

### Credits & Inspiration

The people, projects, and ideas that shaped Swarm Tools. A thank-you to the community.

## Why Archive?

Some documentation is valuable for context but doesn't fit the main navigation:

- **Roadmaps** change frequently and may be outdated
- **Credits** are important but not reference material
- **Historical decisions** explain "why" but aren't actionable

We keep these accessible but separate from the core docs.
