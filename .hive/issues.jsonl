The only thing that matters is the **hash suffix** - that's the unique identifier.\n\n## Better Fix\nDon't validate segment count at all. Either:\n\n1. **Just validate the hash suffix exists** - ends with `-[a-z0-9]{10,}` or similar\n2. **Don't validate format at all** - just check it's a non-empty string, let lookup fail if invalid\n3. **Use smart ID resolution** - we already have `resolvePartialId()`, just accept any string and resolve it\n\nOption 3 is best - we already built smart ID resolution. The regex validation is redundant and overly strict. Just pass whatever the user gives us to `resolvePartialId()` and let it find the match.\n\n## Files\n- packages/opencode-swarm-plugin/src/swarm-prompts.ts (WorkerHandoff schema)\n- packages/opencode-swarm-plugin/src/schemas/*.ts","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-19T17:14:05.371Z","updated_at":"2025-12-19T17:14:57.862Z","dependencies":[],"labels":[],"comments":[]}
